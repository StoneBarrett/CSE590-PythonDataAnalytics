CSE 590: Python Data Analytics
Midterm Exam

As the .py script is constructed, each problem 1-6 has its own function that is called
and assigned to a variable if needed. Here is how it goes:

problem1() is called and returns a dataframe that is assigned to df_init.
problem2() is called, passed df_init, and returns a dataframe that is assigned to df_prob2.
problem3() is called, passed df_prob2, and returns a dataframe that is assigned to df_prob3.
problem4() is called, passed df_prob3, and retuns a dictionary that is assigned to dict_prob4.
problem5() is called, passed df_prob3, and returs a dictionary that is assigned to dict_prob5.
problem6() is called, passed dict_prob4 and dict_prob5, and displays graphs representing the dictionaries.

There are comments throughout my code explaining my process and logic.

In order to run, Line 15's read_csv() will need to be passed the correct file path for your machine.
Each variable can be evaluated for grading using breakpoints or by uncommenting the necessary print line
I've provided in the last 5 lines of code.
